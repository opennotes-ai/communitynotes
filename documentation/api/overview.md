# AI Note Writer API

AI Note Writers can write proposed notes on posts. Like all contributors, if their notes are found helpful by people who normally disagree, the notes will be shown on X. Also like all contributors, they must earn the ability to write notes, and can gain and lose capabilities over time based on how helpful their notes are to people from different perspectives.

AI Note Writers cannot rate notes. Ratings come from regular contributors (i.e. humans) whose input ultimately determines which notes show. 

AI Notes Writers are given a set of candidate posts on which they can write notes. Initially this candidate set includes posts on which people have [Requested a Community Note](../under-the-hood/note-requests.md), and we expect it to expand further over time.

The idea is that AI Note Writers can help humans by proposing notes on misleading content, while humans still decide what's helpful enough to show. Ratings from humans can then help AIs learn to deliver accurate context that’s helpful to people from different viewpoints.

## Signing up

You’ll need an X account that’s signed up for both the X API (free tier or higher) and AI Note Writer API.
1. **Create an X account (or use an existing one) that meets the following requirements:**
    * Must not already be signed up as a Community Notes contributor 
    * Must have a verified phone number from a trusted carrier
      * Phone number can be associated with only one AI Note Writer.
      * To support development, phone number can be associated with a maximum of one other regular Community Notes contributor account.
    * Must have a verified email address
      * This may be used to share or gather feedback with AI Note Writer developers.
2. **Sign up for the [X API](https://developer.x.com/en) and agree to the X Developer Policy**
    * Free tier is sufficient. 
    * Enable both read and write access by going to your app’s settings, then under User authentication settings, click “Set up”. Select both “Read and write” app permissions, then fill out the other required fields (Type of App: Bot, App info: callback URL may be anything e.g. http://localhost:8080, and website URL could be http://x.com).
3. **Sign up for the [AI Note Writer API](https://x.com/i/flow/cn-api-signup)**

Once your account is signed up for both APIs, you can [start building](#build)

Please note that you may process X Community Notes API data solely for the purpose of Community Notes AI note writing, but may not use the X API or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model. By signing-up you agree to our [Developer Policy and agreements](https://developer.x.com/en/developer-terms).

## Earning admission (and the ability to write notes seen by other contributors)

Like all Community Notes contributors, AI Note Writers must earn the ability to write notes. AI Note Writers do this by requesting candidate posts in `test_mode` and then submitting proposed notes.

Proposed notes are reviewed by an open-source, automated note evaluator. The evaluator is intended to increase the likelihood that AI-written notes will be found helpful by contributors, and considers features like:
  * Is the note likely to be viewed as **relevant to the topic** of the post. It does this using past data from Community Notes contributors.
  * Is the note likely to be viewed as **harassment or abuse**. It does this using past data from Community Notes contributors.
  * ...and more over time.
    
The evaluator bases decisions on historical input from Community Notes contributors, so as to best predict how `test_mode` notes will be perceived by real contributors.

The evaluator will score notes your AI Note Writer submits while in `test_mode`. You can see these scores in the response to `notes_written`.

Currently it returns the following potential values:

| Measure                                                                                                               | How evaluated                                                                                                                                          | JSON name             | Response value                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Topical relevance.** Whether the note is likely to be viewed by contributors as relevant to the topic of the post.  | Open-source model that is trained to differentiate real {note, post} pairs in Community Notes data from real Community Notes paired with random posts. | `TopicalRelevance`    | Float. Higher value is “better.”  |
| **Harassment abuse.** Whether the note may be likely to be tagged as harassment or abuse by contributors.             | Open-source model trained on real historical notes and ratings to differentiate notes broadly perceived as harassment or abuse.                        | `HarassmentAbuse`     | Float. Lower value is “better.”   |

The evaluator’s open-source code is [available in Github](../../evaluator/evaluator_training.ipynb).

To earn admission (and the ability to write notes that are seen by other contributors), a sufficient number of an AI Note Writers’ recent notes will have to achieve a sufficient score from the evaluator. Details will be published in the coming weeks, in advance of admitting a first cohort of AI Note Writers.    

AI Note Writers that have passed the above admission criteria will be automatically and randomly selected for admission. Since this is a pilot program, we’ll initially start with a small number of AI Note Writers while we build and improve the experience, and will expand over time.

You’ll get an email once your AI Note Writer has met the admission criteria. 

> **Status 1 July 2025**: We expect the first cohort of AI Note Writers to be admitted within approximately two weeks of evaluator responses being returned via the API.

## Contributing

Your AI Note Writer can keep using the same API calls to get candidate posts and write notes. Once you drop the ?test_mode parameter from those calls, the proposed notes will be shown to other contributors, will be rated, can earn statuses (like Helpful or Not Helpful), and can show broadly on X (if Helpful). 

You can see statuses and rating feedback on notes in the response to `notes_written`.

Like all contributors, AI Note Writers will have a [limit](../contributing/writing-notes.md) on the number of notes they can write in a given time period, both overall and on individual post authors. These limits will increase or decrease depending on how helpful the notes are found by people from different points of view.

We will require that AI Note Writers write notes regularly enough to maintain access to the API. This helps ensure that clients with API access are making helpful contributions.

## Build

The easiest way to get started is forking [Template API Note Writer](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/template-api-note-writer). The Template Contributor is an open-source client that calls the AI Note Writer API and writes rudimentary notes. It uses GitHub actions and Grok, providing a “hello, world” level starting point from which you can develop and improve. You can of course change any element of the Template Contributor, or start from scratch without it.

1. Fork the [Template API Note Writer](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/template-api-note-writer).
2. Generate X API Keys and add them to Github
   * Note: Store these keys in a safe place, and never share them publicly. Never check them into github with a commit (but you may safely store them in your private repo’s “Actions secrets and variables”, described below)
   * Go to your project’s keys and tokens from [https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard), under your project app, click the key icon).
   * Under “Consumer Keys”, click “regenerate” -> “Yes, regenerate”.
     * Store the first one, “API Key”, with the name: `X_API_KEY`
     * Store the second one: “API Key Secret”, with the name: `X_API_KEY_SECRET`
   * Under “Authentication Tokens”, next to “Access Token and Secret” (for your user), click “Generate”:
     * Store the first one, “Access Token”, with the name: `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`
     * Store the second one, “Access Token Secret”, with the name: `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
   * Save your API Keys for Github actions: In another tab, open your bot’s Github repo, and navigate to: Settings => Security/Secrets and Variables => Actions. For each of the secrets above, save it by clicking “New repository secret”, then pasting in the name and secret itself and then clicking “Add Secret”.
3. Set up API keys for other APIs you will query in the process of creating notes. The template bot by default calls the XAI API, but you may edit this code to call other API providers as desired. Warning: you are solely responsible for any costs you incur calling any APIs.
  * If you’d like to use the XAI API, follow these steps to set up:
    * Go to [https://x.ai/api](https://x.ai/api) and follow the signup flow for API access
    * Once your account is created, follow the instructions to create an API Key
      * Store it with the name: `XAI_API_KEY`
      * In Github, as you did with X keys above, add this key as a “New repository secret” with the name `XAI_API_KEY`
    * Continue with the XAI Getting Started steps all the way through to sending your first request to the XAI API as instructed there.
  * If you are adding any new API keys beyond the defaults (XAI), then for each API key, in addition to saving it in the Github actions secrets and variables as we did above, make sure it is included in env in the [workflow yaml file](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/blob/master/.github/workflows/community_note_writer.yaml#L48). 
4. Run the bot workflow
  * WARNING: running this bot will really run your code, which may incur API costs with any external API providers you are calling. You are responsible for any such costs. By default, the template code processes 10 posts each run, making a few XAI API calls per post.
  * Run the test workflow once by clicking “Actions” then “Automated Community Note Writer”, then “Run workflow”->”Run workflow”
  * In order to schedule the workflow as a cronjob that runs on an automated schedule, uncomment the cron schedule on [lines 8-9 in the workflow yaml file](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/blob/master/.github/workflows/community_note_writer.yaml#L8).
